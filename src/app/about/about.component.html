      <h2>BIO: The short version</h2>
      <p>
        USA Today Bestselling author Kalayna Price writes the Alex Craft Novels,
        a new dark urban fantasy series from Roc, and the Novels of Haven from
        Bell Bridge Books. Her works have been translated into several languages
        and are available (or have been contracted for release) in the US, UK,
        Australia, New Zealand, France, Poland, Russia, and Germany. Kalayna
        draws her ideas from the world around her, her studies into ancient
        mythologies, and her obsession with classic folklore. Her stories
        contain not only the mystical elements of fantasy, but also a dash of
        romance, a bit of gritty horror, some humor, and a large serving of
        mystery. Kalayna is a member of SFWA and RWA, and an avid hula-hoop
        dancer who has been known light her hoop on fire. To find out more,

      <h2>Bio: The Long version</h2>
      <p>
        Kalayna Price has always been an avid reader and dreamer. At ten she
        raided her father's fantasy fiction bookcase and her already active
        imagination went into hyperdrive. Her first love was for the epic
        adventures and mythical races and creatures of high fantasy, but she has
        always been drawn to things that go bump in the night. It is that darker
        side of fantasy where she currently devotes her words.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kalayna is the USA Today Bestselling author of two dark urban fantasy
        series: the novels of Haven and the Alex Craft novels, both of which
        have been translated into several languages and are available all over
        the world.

        The Haven Novels, consisting of ONCE BITTEN (January 2009), TWICE DEAD
        (February 2010), and THIRD BLOOD (August 2012), follow the story of Kita
        Nekai, a kitten shapeshifter on the run from her clan and
        responsibilities, who is turned into a vampire and entangled in the
        supernatural underworld. The Alex Craft novels consist thus far of GRAVE
        WITCH (October 2010), GRAVE DANCE (July 2011), and GRAVE MEMORY (July
        2012). The novels follow series title character, Alex Craft, who is a
        broke magic-eye for hire who speaks to the dead. In the first book,
        Grave Witch, a case with a sexy reaper, a dark cop, and a
        ghost-silencing killer has more than Alex's rent on the lineâ€”it may cost
        her soul.

        Kalayna draws her ideas from the world around her, her studies into
        ancient mythologies, and her readings of classic folklore. Her stories
        contain not only the mystical elements of fantasy, but also a dash of
        romance, a bit of gritty horror, some humor, and a large serving of
        mystery.
      </p>

        When not writing, she can be found reading for both pleasure and
        research, locked in her studio with a paintbrush, out in nature with her
        camera, or just about anywhere with a hula-hoop. Yeah, you read that
        correctly. Kalayna thinks hoop dance is about the most entertaining form
        of exercise on the planet, and has been known to hoop with fire.
